## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Visual:** Split screen - left side shows news headlines about rug pulls, right side shows worried investor

**Title:** The $2.8B Problem

**Content:**
```
💸 $2.8 Billion Lost to Crypto Rug Pulls in 2023

❌ 90% of new token launches fail within 1 year

🚨 Investors have no reliable way to assess risk

⚠️ Launchpads struggle to filter out bad actors

📉 Ecosystem trust is eroding
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"The crypto space loses billions to rug pulls every year. Investors can't tell good projects from scams. Launchpads have no systematic way to filter projects. We need a solution."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Solution

```
✅ Automated 7-Dimension Risk Scoring

🎯 Real-time Analysis (0-100 score)

⛓️ On-Chain Verification via Qubic Smart Contract

🛠️ Interactive Builder Sandbox for Founders

📊 Public API for Launchpad Integration
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Nostromo Guardian solves this by providing automated, transparent risk assessment. Every project gets scored across 7 dimensions, verified on-chain, and founders can optimize before launch."

## SLIDE 4: How It Works

**Visual:** Flow diagram showing the process

**Title:** The Scoring Engine

**Content:**
```
[Diagram showing flow:]

Project Submission
    ↓
7-Dimension Analysis
    ↓
Risk Score (0-100)
    ↓
Color-Coded Grade
    ↓
On-Chain Verification
```

**7 Dimensions:**
1. 📊 Tokenomics (20 pts)
2. 🔒 Vesting & Locks (20 pts)
3. 📄 Documentation (15 pts)
4. 👥 Team History (15 pts)
5. 💬 Community (15 pts)
6. 🛡️ Security Audits (10 pts)
7. ⚖️ Legal Compliance (5 pts)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our algorithm analyzes projects across 7 critical dimensions. Each dimension is weighted based on its importance to project success. The result is a simple 0-100 score with a color-coded grade."
