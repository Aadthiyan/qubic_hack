## 📝 Speaker Notes for Each Slide

### Slide 1 (Title)
"Good morning/afternoon. I'm [Name], and I'm excited to present Nostromo Guardian - a risk scoring protocol that's going to make Qubic the safest DeFi ecosystem in crypto."

### Slide 2 (Problem)
"Let's start with the problem. In 2023 alone, $2.8 billion was lost to crypto rug pulls. 90% of new launches fail. Investors have no reliable way to assess risk, and launchpads are struggling to filter out bad actors. This is a massive problem that's eroding trust in the entire ecosystem."

### Slide 3 (Solution)
"Nostromo Guardian solves this with automated, transparent risk assessment. We analyze every project across 7 critical dimensions, generate a simple 0-100 score, verify it on-chain via Qubic smart contract, and provide an interactive sandbox for founders to optimize before launch."

### Slide 4 (How It Works)
"Here's how it works: A project submits their information. Our algorithm analyzes 7 dimensions - from tokenomics to team history to security audits. We calculate a composite score, assign a color-coded grade, and publish it to the Qubic blockchain for immutable verification."

### Slide 5 (Features)
"We've built four core features: A monitoring dashboard for investors, an interactive sandbox for builders to optimize their launch parameters, on-chain verification for trust, and a public API so any launchpad can integrate our scoring."

### Slide 6 (Users)
"This benefits three key groups: Investors get transparency before they invest. Builders get actionable feedback to improve their projects. And launchpads get systematic filtering to reduce liability and attract quality projects."

### Slide 7 (Tech Stack)
"We're built on production-ready technology: Next.js and TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend, and most importantly - a Qubic smart contract written in C++ for immutable score verification."

### Slide 8 (Why Qubic)
"We chose Qubic for four reasons: Speed - fast finality for real-time updates. Security - robust consensus and immutable storage. Cost - affordable fees for high volume. And ecosystem growth - as Qubic's DeFi ecosystem expands, trust infrastructure becomes essential."

### Slide 9 (Contract)
"Our smart contract is live on Qubic Testnet right now. You can verify it yourself on the explorer. This ensures all scores are immutable and publicly auditable - no one can manipulate the data."

### Slide 10 (Business)
"We have three revenue streams: Premium subscriptions at $99/month for advanced features. Launchpad licensing at $499/month for white-label integration. And data licensing for research and analytics. The total addressable market is over $50 million."

### Slide 11 (Roadmap)
"We're already at MVP stage thanks to this hackathon. Next quarter we'll beta launch with partner launchpads. By Q2 we'll deploy to mainnet with a public API and mobile app. Long-term, we'll expand to other chains and implement DAO governance."

### Slide 12 (CTA)
"You can try Nostromo Guardian right now. Scan any of these QR codes to watch the demo, explore the code, or verify our smart contract. Let's work together to make Qubic the safest DeFi ecosystem in crypto. Thank you!"
